          At COP15, global leaders agreed to protecting <br />
          at least 30% of our lands, waters, <br />
          and Ocean by 2030!
        </p>

        <p>
          Global leaders finalized negotiations at the United Nations
          Biodiversity Summit (COP15) in the early morning hours on 19 December
          2022. The historic agreement includes a commitment to conserve 30% of
          our lands, waters, and ocean by 2030 (30×30) by protecting nature
          while respecting indigenous and traditional territories.The global
          commitment to 30×30 was long-awaited and supported by ocean
          conservationists and biodiversity supporters from around the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          TARGET 3 Ensure and enable that by 2030 at least 30 per cent of
          terrestrial, inland water, and of coastal and marine areas, especially
          areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem
          functions and services, are effectively conserved and managed through
          ecologically representative, well-connected and equitably governed
          systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation
          measures, recognizing indigenous and traditional territories, where
          applicable, and integrated into wider landscapes, seascapes and the
          ocean, while ensuring that any sustainable use, where appropriate in
          such areas, is fully consistent with conservation outcomes,
          recognizing and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local
          communities, including over their traditional territories.
        </p>
        <p class="sec1">
          Indigenous peoples are stewards to around 80% of the world’s remaining
          biodiversity. Respecting the rights and leadership of indigenous
          peoples, including over their traditional territories, is not just a
          matter of justice, but the only way we can ensure the successful
          implementation of the new Framework. Target 3 and 22 of the Framework
          addresses the need to work together with Indigenous peoples and ensure
          their inclusion in biodiversity decision making.
