              The diversity of the Hub membership – from smallholder farmers to
              multinational businesses, specialized research institutes to
              intergovernmental organizations – is key to driving the safe
              development of advancing the Adoption of the UN Plastic Treaty
              Across Africa for effective implementation. The breadth of our
              membership implies effective governance is needed to ensure all
              members can fully contribute, while keeping the focus of the hub
              on our core objectives. <br />
              Governance of the Hub is overseen and implemented by two groups:

              Overfishing is widely acknowledged to be one of the major threats
              to marine biodiversity. GAA through its African Small-Scale
              Fisheries Coalition (ASSFC), promotes sustainable fisheries
              management for the benefit of both fishers and the environment.
              Overfishing not only dramatically reduces fish stocks – many of
              the fishing gears used also have devastating impacts on marine
              habitats and on non-target species such as dolphins and turtles;
              bottom trawling and by-catch are of particular concern.
              Overfishing can even cause shifts in the balance of entire marine
              ecosystems through the large-scale removal of predatory fish and
              the trend to “fish down the food web”. (ASSFC), Rebuild Fish Stock
