              The diversity of the Hub membership – from smallholder farmers to
              multinational businesses, specialized research institutes to
              intergovernmental organizations – is key to driving the safe
              development of advancing the Adoption of the UN Plastic Treaty
              Across Africa for effective implementation. The breadth of our
              membership implies effective governance is needed to ensure all
              members can fully contribute, while keeping the focus of the hub
              on our core objectives. <br />
              Governance of the Hub is overseen and implemented by two groups:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The Leadership Committee, composed of representatives of the

                  Organization, International Organizations, founding
                  organizations of the AHEPP: Global Aid for Africa (GAA).

              The diversity of the Hub membership – from smallholder farmers to
              multinational businesses, specialized research institutes to
              intergovernmental organizations – is key to driving the safe
              development of advancing the Adoption of the UN Plastic Treaty
              Across Africa for effective implementation. The breadth of our
              membership implies effective governance is needed to ensure all
              members can fully contribute, while keeping the focus of the hub
              on our core objectives. <br />
              Governance of the Hub is overseen and implemented by two groups:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The Leadership Committee, composed of representatives of the
